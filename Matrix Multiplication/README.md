The objective of this lab was to analyze how the number of threads per block influences GPU scalability and performance, using an NVIDIA Quadro 600 as the test platform. This was accomplished by implementing a parallel matrix multiplication application in CUDA and executing it on square matrices of size 512×512 and 1024×1024. The number of threads per block was systematically varied from 2 to 32, and the resulting execution times were measured. By evaluating these performance trends, the experiment aimed to identify the optimal thread-block configuration that maximizes GPU efficiency.
