This project is a multi-user bookstore application developed in Java and JavaFX. It demonstrates the practical application of OOP principles such as encapsulation and inheritance, as well as the State Machine design pattern to create a functional system. The application supports two main user roles: a customer for browsing and purchasing available books and an admin for inventory and account management.
