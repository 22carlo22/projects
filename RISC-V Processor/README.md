The project adopts a bottom-up design methodology to build a 32-bit RISC processor in VHDL, implemented using the Altera Quartus II toolchain on a Cyclone IV–based DE2-115 FPGA board.

Here is a breakdown of the labs:

lab2 - Registers and Program Counter

lab3 - ALU

lab4 - Memory an Data-Path Integration

lab5 - Control Unit Design

lab6 - Final System Assembly; Final 32-vit CPU
