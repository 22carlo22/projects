The project's objective was to create a media-center application on the Keil MCB1700 Evaluation Board , which would provide three main features: a gallery to display bitmap images , an MP3 player to stream audio from a PC via the USB port , and a single-player Snake game. The user was intended to navigate this application using the board's in-built joystick and control the audio volume with the potentiometer. The entire system was implemented using a multithreading approach to manage the different features and user inputs concurrently.
