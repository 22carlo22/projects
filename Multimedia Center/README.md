The goal of this project was to develop a media-center application for the Keil MCB1700 Evaluation Board. To begin, flow diagrams were created to define the system behavior, including the navigation logic and three core features: an image gallery, an MP3 player, and a Snake game. These components were then implemented in C using the Keil µVision IDE, along with additional resources such as the image assets required by the gallery. After verifying that the application operated as intended, its performance and execution flow were analyzed in Debug mode. The project leveraged multithreading to take full advantage of the ARM Cortex RTOS capabilities.
