This project involved creating a peer-to-peer (P2P) file-sharing application. The system's objective was to explore client-server architecture by implementing two main components: an Index Server and multiple Peers. 

In this network, the Index Server functions similarly to a Domain Name System (DNS), maintaining a database of available content (like movies, songs, or text files) and the addresses of the peers that host them. Peers can register their content with the server, search the server for content hosted by others, and then directly connect to another peer to download that content.
