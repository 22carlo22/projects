The objective of this project was to design and demonstrate an Autonomous Mobile Robot (AMR) capable of independently navigating a maze to locate and extinguish fires, represented by candles. Working as part of a team, we developed an AMR equipped with an ultrasonic-based navigation system, an infrared flame detector, and servo-driven mechanisms for both wheel control and a fan-based extinguishing system. The robot was designed to meet strict size constraints and comply with the requirement to extinguish flames without the use of liquids. The competition setting involved multiple AMRs operating simultaneously, each carrying a lit tea candle at the rear to represent its “life.”

Here is the robot demonstrating its capabilities during the testing phase:
