This project involved designing and implementing a set-associative cache controller in VHDL to manage a 256-byte local SRAM, acting as an intermediary between a CPU and an SDRAM controller. The controller's logic was built to interpret 16-bit addresses, handle read/write requests, and manage cache hit/miss scenarios to ensure data coherence. The final design was synthesized using Xilinx ISE and verified through hardware emulation and debugging on a Xilinx Spartan-3E FPGA.
